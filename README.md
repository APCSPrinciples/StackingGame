Stacking Game
=======================
In this assignment you will write learn some standard game making techniques. You will learn how to check for collisions, add different levels, keep score and add artwork to your game. Your game doesn't have to look or work like any other. Feel free to make modifications and add additional features. You may find the slides that start from 456 of the PythonProcessing.pptx PowerPoint slides helpful.

Suggested steps for completing this assignment.  
--------
* Start by creating a paddle that can be used to catch the falling squares. Create three variables for the Paddles: `paddleX`, `paddleY` and `movingRight`
* Then Create two functions `drawPaddle()` and `movePaddle()`
* Write a `mousePressed()` function to control the movement of the Paddle.
* Create two stacker variables `stackerX` and `stackerY`. Initialize `stackerX` randomly
* Write two stacker functions `drawStacker()` and `moveStacker()`. 
* Write a function that checks for a collision between the stacker and the paddle: `checkForCatch()`. It can use Processing's [`dist()`](http://py.processing.org/reference/dist.html) function
